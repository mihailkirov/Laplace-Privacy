The project consists of implementing and analyzing the Laplace mechanism used for ensuring privacy of data released from a dataset. 
This is a university assignment in collaboration with 2 colleagues (INSA Rennes) aiming to show using diagrams (matplotlib) how the different parameters of the algorithm affect the anonymization of the data.
You can find the questions of the assignment as well as the rapport in the 2 pdf files.
